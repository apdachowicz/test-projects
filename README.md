# Demo Projects.

Projects done to learn or practice concepts, or put together to demonstrate concepts to others.

## Sklearn.

Notebooks that focus on ML using scikit-learn or Tensorflow (with Keras).

Files Included:
### [Kaggle House Prices Competition.](https://github.com/apdachowicz/test-projects/blob/master/sklearn/regression/house-prices-random-forest-regression-analysis.ipynb)
An early notebook from my submission to the [Kaggle House Pricing Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). This notebook focuses more heavily on data exploration and transformation for regression.

### [Sklearn Pipeline Demo.](https://github.com/apdachowicz/test-projects/blob/master/sklearn/regression/sklearn_regression_pipeline_demo.ipynb)
A quick demo using sklearn pipelining for preprocessing and regression model training.

## 538 Riddles.

Notebooks for solutions to 538's Riddlers Questions.

Nate Silver's [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) hosts a fun brain teaser section known as [The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/). If I come across any that seem fun, and that pair well with jupyter notebooks for visualization, I'll add my solutions here! 

Riddler's included:
### [Can You Find The Best Dungeons & Dragons Strategy?](https://github.com/apdachowicz/test-projects/blob/master/538_Riddles/05152020_DnD.ipynb)
May 15, 2020. Link to article [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-find-the-best-dungeons-dragons-strategy/). A fun probability exercise exploring the advantage and disadvantage rules in D&D Fifth Edition.
